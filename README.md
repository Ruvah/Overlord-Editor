# Overlord-Editor

Out of personal interest i've decided to continue my progression on making an editor for the overlord engine. The project was a graduation work for my third year at Digital Arts and Entertainment.

Current goal: Currently I aim to add the many features I wanted to see in the editor when I choose this topic for my graduation work. These include but are not limited to: Adding a Lua as scripting language, gizmo's, building projects to a working exe.

Priority updates: First of all it is essential that now there is no deadline that all prototyped systems and features are converted to a higher quality version.
